## Database Setup

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Copy the collection IDs from Appwrite console and add them to your `.env` file.

### 3. Populate Sample Data (Optional)
Run the population script:
```bash
cd backend
node populateCarousel.js
```

## API Endpoints Added

### Carousel Endpoints
- `GET /api/carousel/top` - Get top carousel images
- `GET /api/carousel/donation` - Get donation carousel images

- `POST /api/members/upload-image` - Upload member profile image

## Features

- Image upload with preview
- Custom toast notifications
- Progress tracking
- Error handling

### ✅ Dynamic Content
- Top carousel pulls from database
- Donation carousel pulls from database  
- Events pull from database
- Services pull from database
- Fallback to static content if database is empty
- Loading states for better UX

### ✅ UI Consistency
- Same beautiful UI design maintained
- Smooth animations preserved

## Current Status

### ✅ **Working Features**
- **Registration System**: Fully connected to backend (`/api/members`)
- **Events**: Successfully pulling from database with 3 events
- **Services**: Successfully pulling from database with 4 services
- **Toast Notifications**: Custom toast from admin folder working
- **Image Uploads**: Member profile images uploading correctly

### ⚠️ **Carousel Status**
- **Top Carousel**: Using fallback static images (database collections not set up)
- **Donation Carousel**: Using fallback static images (database collections not set up)
- **Fallback System**: Working perfectly - no broken images

## Testing Results

1. **✅ Registration**: Working - connects to backend, uploads images, shows success toast
2. **✅ Events**: Working - 3 events loaded from database with proper images
3. **✅ Services**: Working - 4 services loaded from database with proper images  
4. **✅ Carousel**: Working - shows static images as fallback when database is empty

## To Enable Dynamic Carousels (Optional)

1. Create collections in Appwrite console:
   - `top_carousel` with attributes: image (string), title (string), description (string)
   - `donation_carousel` with same attributes
2. Add collection IDs to backend `.env`
3. Run `node populateCarousel.js` to add sample data

## Notes

- **No broken functionality**: Everything works with proper fallbacks
- **UI preserved**: Same beautiful design and animations
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when APIs fail
- **Performance**: Fast loading with proper loading states
