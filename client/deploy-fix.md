# Deployment Fix Instructions

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Routing Issue**: Changed homepage URL from `https://lacoustre.github.io/` to `https://thevogministries.org` in package.json
2. **SPA Routing**: Added `_redirects` and `.htaccess` files to handle client-side routing
3. **QR Code Generation**: Added QR code generator component and page

## Files Modified/Created:

- ✅ `package.json` - Fixed homepage URL
- ✅ `public/_redirects` - For Netlify/Vercel deployment
- ✅ `public/.htaccess` - For Apache servers
- ✅ `src/Components/QRCodeGenerator.jsx` - QR code component
- ✅ `src/Pages/QRCode.jsx` - QR code management page
- ✅ `src/App.js` - Added QR route

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting provider**

3. **Test the routes:**
   - https://thevogministries.org/
   - https://thevogministries.org/join
   - https://thevogministries.org/donation
   - https://thevogministries.org/qr

## QR Code Features:

- Visit `/qr` to generate QR codes
- Download QR codes as PNG files
- Share QR codes directly
- Copy URLs to clipboard
- QR codes for: Join page, Donation page, Homepage

## Testing:

After deployment, test:
1. Direct navigation to `/join` should work
2. Refreshing `/join` page should not redirect to index.html
3. QR codes should point to correct URLs
4. QR code scanning should work properly

## Troubleshooting:

If routing still doesn't work:
- Check if your hosting provider supports SPA routing
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in the deployed build folder
- For Apache servers, ensure `.htaccess` is properly configured
- Contact your hosting provider for SPA routing configuration
